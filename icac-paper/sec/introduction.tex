\item Need for self-adaptation in cloud applications: back it up with
  examples and with solutions from the state of the art.
\item One of these self-adaptive solutions is brownout: briefly
  describe the brownout paradigm and point out that it provides
  advantages in terms of predictability~\cite{icse}.
\item However, there is a risk that it screws up load-balancing
  strategies, since these load balancing strategies are often based on
  quantities that are kept under control by the brownout control
  strategy. Cite Abdelzaher paper and say that it is somehow like they
  prove in AdaptGuard, the load-balancer is an external loop that
  might screw up the internal loop of the replicas or be screwed up
  (which is more common in our case).
\item Therefore we would like to design load-balancing strategies that
  work with brownout-compliant applications possibly boosting the
  performance of the replicas or of the brownout application as a
  whole.
