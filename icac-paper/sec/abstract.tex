% Motivation
Cloud applications are often subject to unexpected events like flash
crowds and hardware failures. Without a predictable behaviour, users
may abandon an unresponsive application.  This problem has been
partially solved on two separate fronts: by adding self-adaptive
features to the applications to bound response times by modifying the
applications behavior, and, second, by introducing replicas for
redundancy and adding a load-balancer to direct load at replicas.

% Problem statement
However, existing load-balancing strategies interfere with
self-adaptivity. Load-balancers are often based on response times,
that are controlled by the self-adaptive features of the application,
hence not being very reliable indicators of how well replicas are
performing.

% Contribution
In this paper, we propose two new load-balancing strategies,
specifically designed to support self-adaptive cloud applications
designed with the brownout paradigm. The load-balancing heuristics
base their decision not on response time, but on user experience
degradation.  We implement our strategies in lighttpd, together with
some state of the art algorithms. Results obtained in multiple
scenarios show that our strategies allow to exploit the trade-off
between two different aspects of user experience: response time and
content degradation, improving the state of the art solutions.
