\begin{itemize}
\item Description of a single replica brownout-compliant
  application. There is an internal control loop. Reference to the
  ICSE paper but a little bit of background repeated.
\item Description of our test architecture. Moving to multiple
  replicas and inserting the load-balancer. Existing load-balancing
  strategies can be tested. \textit{Cristian, is it feasible to test
    also some of the existing? Like RR, FRF-EWMA and predictive (which
    is the standard in a commercial tool)?}
\item Stating the challenge and the desire of maximizing the optional
  components executing without screwing up the gurantees on the
  response times.
