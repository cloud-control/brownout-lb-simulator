In this paper we have revisited the problem of load-balancing
different replicas to include adaptivity on the application side. In
fact, cloud applications are designed to withstand unexpected events
like flash crowds, resource variations or hardware changes but
existing load-balancing solutions do not directly incorporate this
adaptivity. In the paper, three solutions are described, based on
brownout-compliant cloud applications and their behavior.

The experimental results obtained in this paper clearly show that
incorporating the applications adaptation in the design of load
balancing strategies pay off in terms of predictable behavior and
maximized performance. They also demonstrated that the Shortest Queue
First is the best non-aware existing solution, therefore it should be
used whenever it is not possible to implement an ad-hoc solution
capable of boosting the performance of self-adaptive cloud
applications.
