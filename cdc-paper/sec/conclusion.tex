We have revisited the problem of load-balancing different replicas in
the presence of self-adaptivity inside the application.  This is
motivated by the need of cloud applications to withstand unexpected
events like flash crowds, resource variations or hardware changes.  To
fully address these issues, load-balancing solutions need to be
combined with self-adaptive applications, such as brownout, however
simply combining them without special support leads to poor
performance.

Three load-balancing strategies are described, specifically designed
to support brownout-compliant cloud applications.  The experimental
results clearly show that incorporating the application adaptation in
the design of load balancing strategies pay off in terms of
predictable behavior and maximized performance. They also demonstrated
that the Shortest Queue First is the best non-brownout-aware solution,
therefore it should be used whenever it is not possible to adopt one
of our proposed solution.
