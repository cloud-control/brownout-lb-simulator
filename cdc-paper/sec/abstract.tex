% Motivation
Cloud applications are often subject to unexpected events like flash crowds
and hardware failures. Without a predictable behaviour, users may abandon
an unresponsive application.
This problem has been partially solved on two separate fronts:
first, by adding a self-adaptive feature called \emph{brownout} inside cloud applications to bound response times, and, second,
by introducing replicas for redundancy. For the latter, a load-balancer is used to direct load at replicas.

% Problem statement
However, existing load-balancing strategies interfere with brownout self-adaptivity.
These strategies are often based on response times, that
are already controlled by the self-adaptive features of the application, hence they are
not an indicator of how well a replica is performing.

% Contribution
In this paper, we propose new load-balancing strategies, specifically
designed to support brownout applications. We implement our strategies in a self-adaptive
application simulator, together with some state of the art
solutions. Results obtained in multiple
scenarios show that our strategies bring significant improvements when
compated to the state of the art.
