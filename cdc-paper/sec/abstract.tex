% Motivation
Cloud applications are often subject to unexpected events like flash
crowds and hardware failures. Without a predictable behaviour, users
may abandon an unresponsive application.  This problem has been
partially solved on two separate fronts: first, by adding a
self-adaptive feature called \emph{brownout} inside cloud applications
to bound response times by modulating user experience, and, second, by
introducing replicas for redundancy and adding a load-balancer to
direct load at replicas.

% Problem statement
However, existing load-balancing strategies interfere with brownout
self-adaptivity.  These strategies are often based on response times,
that are already controlled by the self-adaptive features of the
application, hence they are not a good indicator of how well a replica
is performing.

% Contribution
In this paper, we propose new load-balancing strategies, specifically
designed to support brownout applications. They base their decision
not on response time, but on user experience degradation.  We
implement our strategies in a self-adaptive application simulator,
together with some state of the art solutions. Results obtained in
multiple scenarios show that our strategies bring significant
improvements when compated to the state of the art.
