% Motivation
Cloud applications have to face unexpected events like flash crowds
and hardware failures. Despite these common events, applications
should behave predictably, providing bounded latencies to the
clients. This problem has been partially solved by enabling
self-adaptive features inside cloud applications and by introducing
replicas for redundancy. Adaptive applications are now able to tune
their behavior to provide responses in a finite and predictable amount
of time.

% Problem statement
However, self-adaptivity interferes with load-balancing strategies,
that should balance the load to the different application
replicas. These strategies are often based on the response times, that
are controlled by the self-adaptive features of the application, not
being anymore informative of the replica's behavior.

% Contribution
We therefore propose different load-balancing strategies, that take
into account the application's self adaptive features and
correspondingly distribute the load to maximize the applications
performance. We implemente our strategies in self-adaptive
applications simulator, together with some state of the art
solutions. This paper compares the obtained results in multiple
scenarios.
